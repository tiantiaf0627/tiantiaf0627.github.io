Biological, environmental, and contextual data was collected from hospital nurses, staff, and medical residents both in the workplace and at home over time. Labels of human experience were collected using a variety of psychologically validated questionnaires sampled on a daily basis at different times during the day. The data sets are publicly available and we encourage researchers to use it for data mining and testing their own human behavior models.","highlights":["Wearable Sensing","Natural Human Understanding"],"startDate":"2017-08","endDate":"2020-12","url":"https://tiles-data.isi.edu/"}]}
