My name is Tiantian Feng, and I grew up in Leshan, China, which is famously for Leshan Giant Buddha. I studied both in Chengdu (both middle school and high school at Chengdu Foreign Language School) and Nanjing (Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, undergraduate). I obtained my master degree at the University of Southern California afterwards. I recently completed my Ph.D. in the Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science at University of Southern California in 2023. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Shrikanth Narayanan, a globally recognized scientist in speech modeling, linguistics, affective computing, and human understanding. 


My research focuses on leveraging sensors and computational methods for understanding natural human behaviors, also with a particular emphasis on inclusiveness and privacy. My research invovles applications such as speech understanding, multimodal understanding, and bio-signal processing, etc. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in industrial sensor design and deploying sensors in research studies. I have interned at both Meta and Amazon as the research scientist. 


I am currently a postdoc researcher in SAIL lab at USC, and I am actively looking for tenure-track or similar positions in academia. Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to collaborate.
